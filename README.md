Clothes Dectection using PCL &amp; Efficient Graph Based Image Detection for a service robot on ROS
=============================================================================================================
This package I implement, was originally contributed to [skuba-athome organization](https://github.com/skuba-athome) 
A ROS package/interface implementation based on PointCloud Library and Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation algorithm,   developed by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher, for clothes detection application.
